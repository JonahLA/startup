### Startup project for CS 260 - BYU Winter 2023
---
I had never used Git with VSCode before so admittedly, all of this was new!
It took me quite a bit to figure out that I needed to save the file in VSCode
in order for me to be able to stage the change and then commit and push it.

I also looked up the link for how to write better commit messages and I am 
trying to implement what I learned about the Conventional Commits standard,
too.

AWS NOTES

public IP address: 3.133.187.35
ssh -i [path to key] ubuntu@3.133.187.35

The server is set up with an elastic IP address so that in the case that the 
server goes offline or needs to reboot or something like that, it will keep
the same IP address.
