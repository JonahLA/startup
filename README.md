### Startup project for CS 260 - BYU Winter 2023
---
I had never used Git with VSCode before so admittedly, all of this was new!
It took me quite a bit to figure out that I needed to save the file in VSCode
in order for me to be able to stage the change and then commit and push it.

I also looked up the link for how to write better commit messages and I am 
trying to implement what I learned about the Conventional Commits standard,
too.

### This vvv is where I did all of my testing

Here, I am adding a few things to then push up to GitHub.
Here are more changes. And more changes.

### Perhaps this will do it. We are gonna fix this issue

Here is the section with my **changes** from *GitHub*
